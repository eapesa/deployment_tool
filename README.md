# Dummy Web Server in ES6

This is just a dummy server for exploration of ES6

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
$> git clone https://github.com/eapesa/deployment_tool.git
```

2. Navigate the root path of the repository:
```
$> cd deployment_tool
```

3. Run `npm install`

4. Configure `config.js.sample` and save to a new file `config.js`.

5. Build or start the application:
```
$> npm run-script start
```

**NOTE:** `start` also runs `build` so you no longer need to build when you run start.
